| Platform          | Fee Structure                           | Effective Fee |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Escrow.com**    | 3.25% (buyer) or 0.89% - 3.25% split  | 3.25%         |
| **Sedo.com**      | 10% minimum, sliding scale             | 10%+          |

| **Your Platform** | 3% total (currently)                   | **3%** ✨     |

**You're the most competitive!** But margins are too thin.

**Recommended:** 5-6% is still highly competitive while being sustainable.

## 💡 Recommendations

### **Option A: 5% Platform Fee (Balanced)**
```
✅ Competitive pricing (half of competitors)
✅ Sustainable ~2% net margin
✅ Covers Stripe fees comfortably
✅ Profitable on all transaction sizes
```

### **Option B: Tiered Pricing**
```
Transactions < $500:     6% (to cover Stripe's higher % impact)
Transactions $500-$2,000: 5%
Transactions > $2,000:    4% (volume discount)
```

### **Option C: Separate Stripe Fee**
```
Platform Fee: 3%
+ Stripe Processing: 3% + $0.30
Total Buyer Pays: ~6% + $0.30

This makes costs transparent but adds complexity.
```
