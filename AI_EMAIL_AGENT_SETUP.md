## üîß How It Works

### 1. Buyer Sends Reply

```
From: buyer@example.com
To: your-reply-address@yourdomain.com
Subject: Re: Interested in example.com

Hi, I'm interested in buying example.com 
but the price seems a bit high. Can you 
offer a discount?
```

### 2. Mailgun Receives Email

Mailgun catches the inbound email and forwards it to your webhook:

```
POST https://yourdomain.com/api/inbound/mailgun
```

### 3. AI Analyzes Intent

```javascript
{
  isInterested: true,
  isPriceObjection: true,
  isNegotiating: true,
  sentiment: "positive"
}
```

### 4. AI Generates Response

The AI agent:
- Reviews conversation history
- Understands buyer's concerns
- Generates persuasive response
- Addresses objections
- Creates urgency

### 5. Automatic Reply Sent

```
From: noreply@yourdomain.com
To: buyer@example.com
Subject: Re: Interested in example.com

Hi there,

Thank you for your interest in example.com! 
I completely understand your concern about pricing.

Let me explain why example.com is worth the 
investment:

1. Premium .com extension - These are becoming 
   increasingly rare and valuable
2. SEO Benefits - The domain has excellent 
   search potential
3. Brand Recognition - Short, memorable domains 
   command higher prices

I have several other interested parties, but 
I'd love to work with you. Would you be open 
to a payment plan to make this easier?

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards
```

## üíæ Database Schema

### email_conversations Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_conversations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  campaign_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  buyer_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  buyer_name VARCHAR(255),
  direction VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- 'inbound' or 'outbound'
  subject TEXT,
  message_content TEXT NOT NULL,
  received_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  user_id INTEGER,
  domain_name VARCHAR(255),
  ai_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No AI Responses Being Sent

**Check:**
1. Is `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in `.env`?
2. Is Mailgun inbound routing configured?
3. Check server logs for errors
4. Verify webhook URL is accessible

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check OpenAI key
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log('OpenAI Key:', process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ? 'Set' : 'Not Set');"
```

---

### Issue: AI Generates Poor Responses

**Solutions:**
1. Upgrade to `gpt-4` for better quality
2. Check campaign `email_tone` setting
3. Review conversation history
4. Adjust temperature in `aiAgent.js` (currently 0.7)

---

### Issue: Mailgun Not Forwarding Emails

**Check:**
1. Is the route active in Mailgun?
2. Is the webhook URL correct and accessible?
3. Test with `curl`:
```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/inbound/mailgun \
  -d "sender=test@example.com" \
  -d "subject=Test" \
  -d "body-plain=Test message"
```

---

### Issue: OpenAI API Errors

**Common errors:**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Check OPENAI_API_KEY |
| 429 Rate Limit | Too many requests | Add delay or upgrade plan |
| 500 Server Error | OpenAI issue | Use fallback response |

The system has a fallback response if OpenAI fails!

---

## üí∞ Cost Estimation

### OpenAI Pricing (as of 2024)

| Model | Input | Output | Est. Cost per Email |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| gpt-3.5-turbo | $0.50/1M tokens | $1.50/1M tokens | ~$0.002 |
| gpt-4o-mini | $0.15/1M tokens | $0.60/1M tokens | ~$0.001 |
| gpt-4 | $30/1M tokens | $60/1M tokens | ~$0.03 |

**Example:** 
- 1,000 emails/month with `gpt-4o-mini` = **~$1/month**
- Very affordable! üí∞

---

## üß™ Testing

### Test Script

Create `test-ai-agent.js`:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const { generateAIResponse } = require('./services/aiAgent');

(async () => {
  const response = await generateAIResponse({
    buyerMessage: "I'm interested but the price is too high",
    domainName: "example.com",
    buyerName: "John",
    conversationHistory: [],
    campaignInfo: { emailTone: 'professional' }
  });

  console.log('AI Response:');
  console.log(response.reply);
})();
```

Run:
```bash
node test-ai-agent.js
```

---

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

### View Conversation Stats

```javascript
// Get total conversations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM email_conversations;

// Get AI response rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ai_generated = true) as ai_responses,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ai_generated = true) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as ai_percentage
FROM email_conversations
WHERE direction = 'outbound';

// Get most active buyers
SELECT 
  buyer_email,
  COUNT(*) as message_count
FROM email_conversations
GROUP BY buyer_email
ORDER BY message_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Never expose API keys** - Keep in `.env`, never commit
2. **Validate webhooks** - Verify requests are from Mailgun
3. **Rate limiting** - Prevent abuse
4. **Monitor costs** - Set OpenAI billing alerts
5. **Review AI responses** - Periodically check quality

---

## üéõÔ∏è Customization

### Adjust AI Personality

Edit `services/aiAgent.js`:

```javascript
const messages = [
  {
    role: 'system',
    content: `You are a friendly domain sales agent...
    
    PERSONALITY:
    - Casual and conversational  // ‚Üê Change this
    - Use emojis sparingly       // ‚Üê Add custom traits
    - Technical when needed      // ‚Üê Adjust style
    `
  }
];
```

### Change Response Temperature

```javascript
temperature: 0.7,  // 0.0 = Conservative, 1.0 = Creative
```
